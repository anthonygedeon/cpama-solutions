## Exercise 9.4.11
Write the following function:

float compute_GPA(char grades [], int n);

The grades array will contain letter grades (A. B, C. D. or F. either upper-case or lower¬ case); n is the length of the array. The function should return the average of the grades (assume that A = 4, B = 3, C = 2. D = 1, and F = 0).
