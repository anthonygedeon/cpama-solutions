### Exercise
Modify the `read_line` function in each of the following ways:

(a) Have it skip whitespace before beginning to store input characters.  
(b) Have it stop reading at the first whitespace character. *Hint*: To determine
whether or not a character is whitespace, call the `isspace` function.  
(c) Have it stop reading at the first newline character, then store the newline
character in the string.  
(d) Have it leave behind characters that it doesn't have room to store.
