## Exercise 5.1.8
 The following if statement is unnecessarily complicated. Simplify it as much as possible. (Hint: The entire statement can be replaced by a single assignment.)

```
if (age >= 13) 
    if (age <= 19) 
        teenager = true; 
    else
        teenager = false; 
else if (age < 13) 
    teenager = false;
```
