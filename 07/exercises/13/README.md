## Exercise 7.1.13
Assume that a program contains the following declarations:

char c = 1 \1'; short s = 2; int i = -3; long m = 5; float f = 6.5f; double d = 7.5;

Give the value and the type of each expression listed below.

(a) c + i (c) f / c (e) f - d

(b) s + m (d) d / s (0 (int) f

## Solution
(a) char * int 
type  = int
value = -3

(b) s + m
type  = long
value = 7

(c) f / c
type  = float
value = 6.5

(d) d / s
type  = double
value = 3.75

(e) f - d
type  = double
value = -1.0 

(f) (int) f
type  = int
value = 6
