### Exercise 2.04
Write a program that declares several int and float variables—without initializing them—and then prints their values. Is there any pattern to the values? (Usually there isn’t.)

### Solution
There is no pattern besides the values of each variable being `0` for `int` and `0.00000` being for `float`
